            <h1>What is a key signature?</h1>
            <p>The key signature of a piece is found right at the beginning next to the clef. This collection of sharps
                and flats (or lack of) determines in what key the piece was composed. It will let you know what notes
                you need to make sharp or flat.</p>
            <br>
            <p>There are twelve major keys and twelve minor keys. Each major key has a relative minor key, as each minor
                key has a relative major key.</p>
            <h2>How can I find a key's relative minor/major?</h2>
            <p>If you are starting with a major key, just go down a minor third. This will give you the name of its
                relative minor.</p>
            <p>If you've got a minor key, you will need to go up a minor third to get the name of its relative major!
            </p>
            <p>Example: I'm not sure what C major's relative minor key is!
                <br>I will go down a minor third (C - B - A). A minor is therefore the relative minor!
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="memorise">
            <p>Before we get into the nitty gritty, there are four key signatures that you will need to memorise.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>C major and its relative minor : A minor</li>
                <p>This one has no sharps or flats!</p>
                <li>F major and its relative minor: D minor</li>
                <p>You'll see why we need to memorise this in a bit!</p>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="major-sharp">
            <p>When you first look at a piece of music, take note of whether it has sharps or flats in the key
                signature. Let's pretend you have a few sharps and you know that it is a major key. Now, look at the last sharp in the collection (the one
                furthest to the right). To determine the key, simply take this sharp, go up a semi-tone (half-step),
                and this will tell you the name of the key!</p>
        </div>
        <div id="major-flat">
            <p>Now, how about if you know it is major but it has flats? Find the second to last flat from the group. Take the name of the line or space that it's on and add "flat" to its name and voil√†.</p>
