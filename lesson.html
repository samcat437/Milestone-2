                <h1 class="pb-3">What is a key signature?</h1>
                <p>The key signature of a piece of music is found right at the beginning next to the clef. This collection of
                    sharps
                    and flats (or lack thereof) determines in what key the piece was composed and needs to be played. It will let you know what
                    notes
                    you need to make sharp or flat.</p>
                <p>There are twelve major keys and twelve minor keys. Each major key has a relative minor key, as each
                    minor
                    key has a relative major key.</p>

                <h2 class="pb-3">How can I find a key's relative minor/major?</h2>
                <p>If you are starting with a major key, just go down a minor third. This will give you the name of its
                    relative minor.</p>
                <p>If you've got a minor key, you will need to go up a minor third to get the name of its relative
                    major!
                </p>
                <p>Example: I'm not sure what C major's relative minor key is!
                    <br>I will go down a minor third (C - Bb - A). A minor is therefore the relative minor!

                <h2 class="pb-3">Here's how you figure out your major sharp keys...</h2>
                <p>When you first look at a piece of music, take note of whether it has sharps or flats in the key
                    signature. Let's pretend you have a few sharps and you know that it is a major key. Now, look at the
                    last sharp in the collection (the one
                    furthest to the right). To determine the key, simply take this sharp, go up a semi-tone (half-step),
                    and this will tell you the name of the key!</p>
            </div>

        <section id="major-flat" class="row justify-content-center py-5">
            <div class="col-10 text-start">
                <h2 class="pb-3">...and your major flat keys.</h2>
                <p>Now, how about if you know it is major but it has flats? Find the second to last flat from the group.
                    Take the name of the line or space that it's on and add "flat" to its name and voil√†.</p>
                <p>Consider F major however, our friend with one flat. It only has one flat --b flat-- so we can't find
                    the
                    second to last flat. This is why we need to just remember it!</p>

        <section id="minor" class="row justify-content-center py-5">
            <div class="col-10 text-start">
                <h2 class="pb-3">Is there a quick way to figure out minor key signatures?</h2>
                <p>The easiest way is to simply go down a minor third from your major key. There is no shortcut that
                    works
                    to tell us the minor key sadly. On a positive note, this method will help get you quick at thinking
                    about intervals, which is always useful as a musician.</p>

                <h2 class="pb-3">How do we tell whether a piece is major or minor in the first place?</h2>
                <p>As we know, the easiest way to tell the key signature is to start with the major key signature and
                    then
                    go down a minor third to figure out its relative minor, so you can start by thinking about the major
                    regardless. Once you know which keys options you have, ask yourself these questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Have I heard the piece before? Is it happy or sad sounding? Happy is most likely major and sad
                        is
                        probably minor.</li>
                    <li>What is the last note? Is it the name of the major or minor key? Is it the 3rd or 5th scale
                        degrees
                        of either the major or minor key?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Remember, the third scale degree of a scale determines whether it is major or minor.</p>
